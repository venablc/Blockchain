# blockchain

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic blockchain concepts. 

The project is centered around the blockchain node with interfaces for different node hosts (e.g. to facilitate an HTTP API)
and connectors, allowing multiple nodes to be connected for purposes of replications using any proprietary framework.
